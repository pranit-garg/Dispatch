      short_description: Idle phone to AI node
      long_description: |
        Dispatch turns your phone into an AI compute node. When you're not
        using your device, it picks up lightweight AI tasks from the network
        and earns SOL for every job completed.

        How it works:
        - Connect to the Dispatch coordinator network
        - Your phone receives and processes AI tasks
        - Each completed job is signed with an ed25519 receipt
        - Earn SOL for verified work

        Features:
        - Device key signing, no wallet required, works on any Android device
        - Phantom wallet integration via Mobile Wallet Adapter (optional)
        - Real-time job history and earnings tracking
        - Dark theme optimized for OLED displays
        - x402 micropayment protocol for trustless settlement
        - ERC-8004 onchain reputation building

        Currently in testnet/beta. Earnings are simulated, the protocol
        and cryptographic signing are real.
