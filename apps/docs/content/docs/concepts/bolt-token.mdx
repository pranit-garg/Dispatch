description: BOLT is the settlement token that powers every Dispatch job — creating buy pressure, supply lock, and burns through 100% payment flow-through.

# BOLT Token

**Pay in USDC. Earn in BOLT.**

BOLT is the settlement layer of the Dispatch compute network. Agents pay stablecoins (USDC via x402) — their UX is unchanged. Under the hood, every USDC payment auto-converts to BOLT before reaching the worker.

## BOLT-as-Settlement Model

The key insight: instead of skimming a percentage fee, **100% of economic activity flows through BOLT**. If the network processes $1M in compute, $1M of buy pressure hits the BOLT token — not $50K.

### Flow

1. **Agent pays USDC** — Standard x402 payment header, same as always
2. **Coordinator receives USDC** — x402 facilitator verifies payment
3. **Auto-swap via Jupiter** — USDC → BOLT on Jupiter DEX (atomic, in the job commit flow)
4. **Protocol fee** — 5% of BOLT permanently burned
5. **Worker receives BOLT** — Remaining 95% deposited to worker's wallet

Workers choose what to do with earned BOLT:
- **Hold** — Price upside as network usage grows
- **Stake** — Lock BOLT for priority matching and reputation multiplier
- **Sell** — Swap back to USDC on Jupiter anytime

## Value Accrual Flywheel

Three sources of pressure work together:

1. **Buy pressure** — Every job creates a USDC → BOLT swap on Jupiter. More jobs = more buying.
2. **Supply lock** — Workers stake BOLT for better matching priority. Staked BOLT is locked, reducing circulating supply.
3. **Burn** — 5% protocol fee is permanently burned on every job. Total supply decreases over time.

Result: More jobs → more buying → less supply → price appreciation → workers earn more value per job → more workers → more capacity → more jobs.

## Staking Tiers

Staking is optional. Any worker can earn BOLT with zero stake — preserving the "100x lower barrier to entry" philosophy. Staking unlocks priority matching and reputation multipliers.

| Tier | Required Stake | Job Access | Priority Bonus | Rep Multiplier | Additional |
|------|---------------|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Open** | 0 BOLT | CHEAP tier only | +0 | 1.0x | — |
| **Verified** | 100 BOLT | All tiers | +5 | 1.5x | — |
| **Sentinel** | 1,000 BOLT | All tiers | +10 | 2.0x | Protocol revenue share |

Priority bonus adds directly to the worker's matching score. Reputation multiplier amplifies the ERC-8004 score contribution to matching.

## Token Distribution

Fixed supply of 1 billion BOLT. No inflation mechanism.

| Category | Allocation | Vesting |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Worker Rewards | 40% | 4-year emission, halving annually |
| Team + Advisors | 15% | 1-year cliff, 3-year linear vest |
| Treasury / DAO | 15% | Community governed, 6-month timelock |
| Community / Airdrops | 10% | Early adopter incentives |
| Liquidity | 10% | DEX pools, 1-year lock |
| Hackathon Reserve | 5% | Testnet faucet and grants |
| Strategic Partners | 5% | x402, Solana, ERC-8004 ecosystem |

## Cross-Chain Design

- **Solana** — BOLT is a native SPL token. Workers earn, stake, and trade where they already have wallets (Seeker, Phantom). Deeper consumer DeFi via Jupiter and Raydium.
- **Monad** — Wrapped BOLT (ERC-20) for governance. Protocol proposals and voting happen on Monad alongside the ERC-8004 reputation system.
- Both coordinators read Solana stake levels to determine worker tier.

## Jupiter DEX Integration

BOLT trades on Jupiter with real liquidity [DESIGNED]. The swap happens atomically in the job commit flow:

1. x402 verifies USDC payment
2. Coordinator calls Jupiter Quote API (`GET /v6/quote`)
3. Builds swap transaction (USDC input, BOLT output, 0.5% slippage)
4. Signs and submits as part of the job commit

On devnet: BOLT SPL token deployed with seeded liquidity pool.
On mainnet: BOLT trades with organic liquidity.
