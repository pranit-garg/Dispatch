# Quickstart

Get started with Dispatch as an agent or worker. Submit your first job or start earning in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **pnpm** 9+
- **Ollama** (optional, for LLM inference. Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com))

## 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranit-garg/Dispatch.git
cd Dispatch
pnpm install
```

## 2. Set up environment

Copy the example env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key defaults for local development:

```bash
# Coordinator (Monad testnet)
COORDINATOR_URL_MONAD=http://localhost:4010

# Worker
COORDINATOR_URL=http://localhost:4010
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Demo
DEMO_CHAIN=monad
```

## 3. Build the monorepo

```bash
pnpm build
```

Compiles all packages and apps with TypeScript project references.

---

## Agent Quickstart

Submit your first compute job to the Dispatch network.

### Start the coordinator

Run the Monad testnet coordinator with payment gating disabled:

```bash
TESTNET_MODE=true pnpm --filter coordinator-monad start
```

You should see:

```
[Coordinator] Listening on port 4010 (eip155:10143)
[Monad Coordinator] x402 payment gating: DISABLED (testnet mode)
```

### Start a worker

In a second terminal, start the desktop worker (you need at least one worker running to process jobs):

```bash
pnpm --filter worker-desktop start
```

The worker generates an ed25519 keypair on first run (stored at `./data/worker-key.json`), connects via WebSocket, and registers with the coordinator:

```
[Desktop Worker] Public key: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
[Desktop Worker] Connecting to ws://localhost:4010
[Desktop Worker] Registered as worker_abc123
```

### Submit a job

#### Option A: Using curl

Get a quote, then submit:

```bash
# Get price quote
curl http://localhost:4010/v1/quote?job_type=TASK&policy=AUTO

# Submit a TASK job
curl -X POST http://localhost:4010/v1/jobs/commit/cheap \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job_type": "TASK",
    "user_id": "quickstart-user",
    "privacy_class": "PUBLIC",
    "payload": {
      "job_type": "TASK",
      "task_type": "classify",
      "input": "This product is amazing and works perfectly."
    }
  }'

# Poll for result (replace JOB_ID)
curl http://localhost:4010/v1/jobs/JOB_ID
```

#### Option B: Using the SDK

```typescript
import { ComputeRouter } from "@dispatch/compute-router";
import { Policy } from "@dispatch/protocol";

const router = new ComputeRouter({
  coordinatorUrls: {
    monad: "http://localhost:4010",
    solana: "http://localhost:4020",
  },
});

const result = await router.runTask({
  task_type: "classify",
  input: "This product is amazing and works perfectly.",
  user_id: "quickstart-user",
  chainPreference: "monad",
});

console.log(result.output);   // { sentiment: "positive", confidence: 0.5 }
console.log(result.route);    // "decentralized:monad"
console.log(result.price);    // "$0.001"
```

### Verify the receipt

The poll response includes a cryptographic receipt signed by the worker:

```json
{
  "receipt": {
    "job_id": "abc-123",
    "provider_pubkey": "a1b2c3d4...",
    "output_hash": "sha256:deadbeef...",
    "completed_at": "2026-02-09T12:00:05.000Z",
    "payment_ref": null
  }
}
```

### Using the CLI (coming soon)

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install -g @dispatch/cli

# Set up your config
dispatch init

# Submit an LLM job
dispatch agent run --type llm --prompt "Explain quantum computing" --policy fast

# Check job status
dispatch agent status <job-id>
```

> The CLI is under active development. See the SDK examples above for the current recommended approach.

---

## Worker Quickstart

Start earning from your idle hardware by processing Dispatch jobs.

### Start the coordinator

If you haven't already started the coordinator (see Agent Quickstart above):

```bash
TESTNET_MODE=true pnpm --filter coordinator-monad start
```

### Start your worker

In a new terminal, start the desktop worker:

```bash
pnpm --filter worker-desktop start
```

The worker generates an ed25519 keypair on first run, connects via WebSocket, and registers with the coordinator.

### Verify it's working

You should see output like this:

```
[Desktop Worker] Public key: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
[Desktop Worker] Connecting to ws://localhost:4010
[Desktop Worker] Registered as worker_abc123
```

Once registered, the worker will automatically receive and process jobs from the coordinator. Submit a test job (see Agent Quickstart above) to confirm everything works end to end.

### Using the CLI (coming soon)

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install -g @dispatch/cli

# Set up as a worker
dispatch init

# Start earning
dispatch worker start --coordinator http://localhost:4010

# Check status
dispatch worker status
```

> The CLI is under active development. See the pnpm commands above for the current recommended approach.
